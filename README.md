OxygenDelta is a compact price-discrepancy tracker 📈 built for prediction markets like Polymarket and similar platforms. It compares related outcome prices in real time and calculates percentage spreads, helping highlight situations where price differences move beyond rational ranges ⚡💡.

The project focuses strictly on the essentials: fast updates, accurate formulas, and clean market data ⚙️📊. OxygenDelta aggregates markets, normalizes probabilities, and highlights price deltas that can be used to assess inefficiencies between platforms or between outcomes within the same event 🔍📉.

This is a purely analytical tool 🧠. It does not execute trades, does not interact with user funds, and does not interfere with platform operations. The tracker delivers structured, transparent data so users can independently evaluate price differences and make informed decisions 🤝📈.

OxygenDelta is designed for users who understand spreads, liquidity, and probabilities and want a streamlined way to systematically monitor market discrepancies without unnecessary noise 🚀✨
