OxygenDelta

OxygenDelta is an analytical monitoring tool for identifying price spreads and structured market discrepancies across prediction markets such as Polymarket and similar platforms.

The system continuously collects publicly available market data and evaluates key metrics, including outcome prices, implied probabilities, relative deltas, and percentage spreads between correlated or opposing outcomes. All incoming data is normalized to ensure consistent comparison across different market structures.

How It Works

OxygenDelta analyzes related outcomes within the same event or across comparable markets and calculates price deviations using transparent mathematical models. When a deviation exceeds user-defined thresholds, it is highlighted as a notable spread. Optional filters account for market activity and data consistency to minimize noise.

The tool does not generate forecasts, recommendations, or automated actions. It provides structured analytical output that allows users to independently assess observed price differences.

Data Access & Security

OxygenDelta operates in a read-only mode:

No account credentials required

No wallet connections

No private or user-specific data access

No interaction with platform operations

All analysis is performed using publicly accessible market information.

Alerts & Monitoring

The system supports configurable alerts based on spread parameters. Notifications are triggered when monitored values meet predefined conditions, enabling timely review without automated execution or intervention.

Intended Use

OxygenDelta is designed for developers, analysts, and advanced users interested in systematic monitoring of market price discrepancies. The project emphasizes data integrity, transparency, and extensibility, making it suitable for research, analysis, and integration into custom workflows.
